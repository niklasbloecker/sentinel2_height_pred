# Sentinel-2 Height prediction

Task was to predict the height values of a given Sentinel-2 satellite image. 

Very sparse labels were given as training data so that further image pre-processing was necessary. 

While multiple different ML approaches were tried, the final submission contained a trained XGB and CNN model. The models were optimized using Grid- & Random-Search for further performance improvements.

The task was carried out as a group in the context of the Data Analytics 2 module.
